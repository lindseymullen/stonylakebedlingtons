                <p>Kris purchased her first Bedlington in 1980 from Claremont Kennels in Auburn Hills Michigan. Ch
                    Claremont Myrna Mist "Misty" went on to produce a litter of 11 puppies and one of 10 before she was
                    spayed. All the dogs we have bred since that time can trace their pedigree back to Misty. She got
                    the show bug at a puppy match when 12 week old Claremont Fire Truck went Best in Match with an entry
                    of about 400 puppies. Since that time she has bred more that 40 champions and has owned 2 that she
                    did not breed.</p>
                <p>Lindsey was born into Bedlingtons going to her first show at 8 weeks old, and showing her
                    first dog and beating Kris when she was 5. Lindsey has bred 10 champions since her first litter was
                    born in 2014. Lindsey competed in junior showmanship starting at age 9 until she aged out at 18. She
                    was invited to the Eukanuba/Royal Canin Show all 9 years she was eligible, however never made it to
                    Westminster because of choosing to play volleyball throughout high school and slowing down on dog
                    showing. Lindsey and Kris have both competed in agility and FastCat with dogs in the past.</p>
